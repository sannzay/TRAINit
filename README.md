# TRAIit
## About:
“trAIn it” is a game which is integrated with an AI game bot where the user trains it in the game itself by playing with it. Which is later competed with the other game bot of other player. So the skills of the bot are directly proportional to the time user spends with his/her bot.
 
## Scope:
This idea can be used on all current major games, like if we take a game “Pokemon Go”, Ash trains the Pikachu by playing with it and send it to the battle field to fight with other Pokemons. 
Like-wise its span is large and can be used in all kinds of games like:
1.	Dragon fantasy games
2.	Fighting games
3.	Logic games like chess
4.	 Kid games

Our Game Plan:
To keep it simple, we initial are expecting it to use the idea in the ping pong game. Here the user is an Old wrecked bat which trains the new generation young bats (which is a bot) to play ping pong and send them to play with the other young bats of other users.

## Implementation results:


### 1. Ping Pong using Deep Q Learning:

After training the algorithm on the ping pong game environment for a week there was a change in the behavior of the Academic AI (on right side) when allowed to play with the Consumer AI (on left). Though the results were not inhabitable to my use case, there was improvement.


### 2. Ping Pong using Policy Gradient:

After training for almost 90 hours it achieved a notable result. The Academic AI beat Consumer AI by 5 scores when the total score to win an episode was 20. Green bat is our Academic AI which learns. Orange is Consumer AI which acts according to the heuristics it is designed with.
